She is listed in the Guinness Book of World Records as the most recorded artist in the world. She started her musical journery in 1942 and has spanned over seven decades. Lata is said to have recorded songs for over a thousand Hindi films. She also has the credit of having sung in over thirty-six regional Indian languages and foreign languages.
